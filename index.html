		<h2>Chapter 11. Using NetView Management Console Command Profiles</h2>
		<div style="padding-left: 10%;">
		<p>This chapter contains Programming Interface information.</p>
		<p>When operators use the topology console, available commands are displayed in the context menu for a selected resource. Also, resource independent commands are shown in a context menu if you right-click the view background. Because
operators have different areas of responsibility, levels of authority, and preferences, you might want to customize the command menus. Use the command profile editor batch-utility to control the content, order, and capabilities of these menus for an individual operator or group of operators.
</p>
			<p>The NetView management console provides a command profile editor batch-utility on both Windows and AIX or Linux platforms.</p>

		<h3>Understanding Command Profiles</h3>
		<div style="padding-left: 10%;">
			<p>Command profiles contain the following objects:</p>
			<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
				<li>Resource managers</li>
				<li>Commands and command sets</li>
				<li>Profiles</li>
				<li>Operators</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			<h3 style="padding-left: 5%;">Resource Manager Objects</h3>
			<div style="padding-left: 10%">
				<p>Resource manager objects represent applications that manage specific resources. The properties of a resource manager define a unique range of command indicators and specify the values in that range that are enabled for commands. You can use the command profile editor to add, change, or delete resource managers.</p>
				<p>A command indicator is a numeric identifier assigned to a resource by its controlling resource manager. Each resource manager is assigned a unique range of values that it can define. Unless you are creating a resource management application or performing actions on behalf of such an application, you probably never need to alter the properties of a resource manager.</p>
				<p><b>Note:</b> The first <i>32767</i> command indicators are available for customer use. Command indicators <i>32768</i> to <i>65534</i> are not defined and they are reserved for current and future Tivoli use. For a detailed description of these command indicators, see the <i>IBM Tivoli NetView for z/OS Data Model Reference</i>.</p>
				
			</div>
			<h3>Commands and Command Set Objects</h3>
			<div  style="padding-left: 10%">
				
				<p>Command objects represent menu items that can be displayed in the context menus for selected resources. Command set objects also represent menu items, but command set items have submenus of commands or other command sets associated with them. The command set object specifies the order and content of the submenu. You can use the command profile editor to add, change, and delete commands and command sets.</p>
				<p>Commands consist of the following items:</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: square;" >
					<li>A command definition page that defines the purpose and behavior of the command</li>
					<li>One or more implementation pages that describe the command exits that are responsible for carrying out the command</li>
					
				</ul>
				<p>Command sets are composed of one or more commands or command sets. </p>
				<p>Many commands have a common meaning for a wide variety of resource types.
However, the mechanics of carrying out this command can vary from one resource type to another.
</p>
				<p>For example, a Lotus Notes resource is started differently than a NetView resource, which is activated differently than a Tivoli Enterprise Console resource. This is because a variety of syntaxes and command exits are used; therefore command objects are composed of multiple implementation pages. When a command is issued, a single page is selected (based on the command indicator of the target resource).</p>
				<p>For example, you can create a <i>Stop</i> Tasks command that is enabled for Lotus Notes resources, but not for Tivoli Enterprise Console resources. You can do this by defining a command called <i>Stop</i> Tasks and defining a page for Lotus Notes resources but not defining a page for Tivoli Enterprise Console resources.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Profile Objects</h3>
			<div style="padding-left: 10%;">
				<p>Profile objects represent a collection of commands. Through the commands, command sets, and separators, the profile objects define the content and order of the items on the context menus. You can use the command profile editor to add, change, and delete command profiles.</p>
				<p>A profile can be shared by multiple operators. An operator object is created for each operator who does not want to use the default profile. The operator object is then assigned a profile object. Changes to a profile affect all operators using that profile. This method makes it easier to maintain profiles and ensures that operators are using the same commands.</p>
				<p>Note: A profile named default is used for all operators who do not have a specific operator definition. The default profile is appended by the topology server during initialization when processing component description files or business description files (CDF/BDF) of instrumented applications. This is done for the Topology Display Subsystem view.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Operator Objects</h3>
			<div style="padding-left: 10%;">
				<p>An operator object represents a topology console operator and is associated with that operator by a common name. An operator object specifies the profile object assigned to the operator. You can use the command profile editor to add, change, or delete operators.</p>
				<p>When an operator right-clicks a resource, the profile object used to populate the context menus for that operator is identified in the following ways:</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
					<li>If an operator object exists with the same name, its specified profile object is used.</li>
					<li>If an operator object does not exist with the same name, but a profile object with the name default exists, the profile object is used.</li>
					<li>Otherwise, no commands from the command profile editor are displayed on the context menu.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Note:</b> When you delete or rename the default profile, only operators with operator objects assigned to them have access to commands from the NetView management console. You can use this to provide security for a topology server.</p>
			</div>
			<hr style="border: 1px solid black"/>
			<h3>Using the Command Profile Editor Batch Utility</h3>
			<div style="padding-left: 10%;">
				<p>You can use the command profile editor batch utility program to add, change, or delete commands in the command profile editor database. The batch utility runs on the Windows and AIX or Linux platforms that are supported by the topology server. The utility uses a text file (the response file), which contains responses to all the parameters used in creating commands.</p>
				<p>The command profile editor batch utility can do the following things:</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: square">
					<li>Create a response file from the information currently in the command profile editor database of the topology server. Note that the response file can be used as a backup for the command profile editor database or for synchronizing your topology servers.</li>
					<li>Update the command profile editor database of the topology server from a response file.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Any program can provide a response file and run the batch utility to add commands to the command profile editor database.</p>
					<p>Two sample response files are provided with the command profile editor. These are available from the databases of the NetView management console topology server. The following samples are provided for customizing the commands:</p>
				<p><b>ihsscpe</b></p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
					<li>Base commands that are shipped with the NetView management console topology server</li>
					
				</ul>
				<p><b>flccpe</b> Commands for MultiSystem Manager (MSM) resources</p>
				<p>These files are located in the following directories:</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
					<li>ihsscpe, for Windows systems: %BINDIR%\TDS\server\sample\ihsscpe.xxx.rsp</li>
					<li>ihsscpe, for AIX or Linux systems: $BINDIR/TDS/server/sample/ihsscpe.xxx.rsp</li>
					<li>flccpe, for Windows systems: %BINDIR%\TDS\server\sample\flccpe.xxx.rsp</li>
					<li>flccpe, for AIX or Linux systems: $BINDIR/TDS/server/sample/flccpe.xxx.rsp</li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Note: </b>xxx is a country code indicator, such as en_US.</p>
				<p>
Depending on the parameters specified on the command line, the utility adds, modifies, or deletes commands. The command profile editor utility does not save information to the topology server until the entire response file is processed and verified. If the entire file cannot be processed successfully, no updates are made in the topology server database.
</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Starting the Command Profile Batch Utility</h3>
				<div style="padding-left: 10%;">
					<p>To run the command profile editor batch utility, issue the cpebatch command from one of the following directories:</p>
					<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
						<li>For Windows systems: %BINDIR%\TDS\server\bin</li>
						<li>For AIX or Linux systems: $BINDIR/TDS/server/bin</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
		<h3>Input and Output Files of the Response File</h3>
		<div style="padding-left: 10%;">
			<p>The format for the input and output of the response file is identical. The response file is a standard ASCII file containing assignment statements that are generally in the form of keyword = value. The keyword is on the left side of the statement and identifies the parameter. The value is on the right side of the statement and either assigns a value to the keyword, or contains a block of keyword and value assignments.</p>
			<p>Lines in which the first nonblank character is an asterisk (*) are comments and are ignored by the utility. Comments can be either inside a block or outside a block, for example:</p>
			<img src="Screenshot%202024-01-24%20163356.png" style="width: 60vw;"/>
			<p>The preceding example creates a manager named SNA and assigns it a range of command indicators from 5 to 10. It also creates three indicators for that manager, the lowest indicator defined is 5. For an example input file, see:</p>
			<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
				<li>For Windows systems: %BINDIR%\TDS\server\Sample\ihsscpe.xxx.rsp</li>
				<li>For AIX or Linux systems: $BINDIR/TDS/server/Sample/ihsscpe.xxx.rsp</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Note: </b>XXX is a country code indicator, such as en_US.</p>
			<p>The response file is processed in a single pass; therefore, the order of the main blocks of keywords is important. Use the following order:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Manager</li>
				<li>Command</li>
				<li>Command_Set</li>
				<li>Profile</li>
				<li>Operator</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You cannot use items before they are defined in the response file. For example, if command set A embeds command set B, command set B must be defined first.</p>
			<p>You can omit any block as long as all the required keywords are already defined in the topology server. For example, if you add a command and the resource manager is already defined in the topology server, it is not necessary to define the manager in the response file.</p>
			<p>You can delete a block from the current database by placing the DELETE keyword inside the block.</p>
			<p><b>Note: </b>Before deleting a command or command set, it must first be removed from any profiles or command sets that contain it. To do this, use the REMOVE_COMMAND or REMOVE_COMMAND_SET option of the MENU keyword for each profile or command set that contains the command or command set. </p>
			<p>You can delete the following types of blocks:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Manager</li>
				<li>Command</li>
				<li>Command_Set</li>
				<li>Profile</li>
				<li>Operator</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Manager Keywords</h3>
